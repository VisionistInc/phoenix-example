# Phoenix Example Project

Hey. This is the Visionist Phoenix example project from the tech talk.  :)

## Running the example

First, `git clone` this repo!

To get your Elixir development environment up and running, start with [the Installation section of the Phoenix guidebook](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html).  Follow the steps for your operating system of choice to get Elixir and Phoenix installed locally.

To start the example server:

  * Run `mix setup` in the Git clone to install and setup dependencies
  * Start the server with `mix phx.server`, or (_pro tip_) inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

You should now be able to load the boilerplate page [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Here are the example server pages mentioned in the tech talk:

  * [`http://localhost:4000/sliders`: The sliders channel demo](http://localhost:4000/sliders)
  * [`http://localhost:4000/dev/dashboard`: The Phoenix LiveDashboard](http://localhost:4000/dev/dashboard)
